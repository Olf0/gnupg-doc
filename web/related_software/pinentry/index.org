* pinentry

  /pinentry/ is a small collection of dialog programs that allow GnuPG
  to read passphrases and PIN numbers in a secure manner. There are
  versions for the common GTK and Qt toolkits as well as for the text
  terminal (Curses).

  See the [[file:~/s/gnupg-web/web/download/index.org::pinentry][download]] section for the latest tarball.
