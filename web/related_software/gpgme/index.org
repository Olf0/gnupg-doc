* GPGME

  /GnuPG Made Easy/ (GPGME) is a library designed to make access to
  GnuPG easier for applications. It provides a High-Level Crypto API
  for encryption, decryption, signing, signature verification and key
  management. Currently it uses GnuPG as its backend but the API isn't
  restricted to this engine; in fact we have already developed a
  backend for CMS (S/MIME).

  Because the direct use of GnuPG from an application can be a
  complicated programming task, it is suggested that all software
  should try to use GPGME instead. This way bug fixes or improvements
  can be done at a central place and every application benefits from
  this.

  Especially authors of
  #+html: <abbr title="Mail User Agent; e.g. a mail reader">
  MUAs
  #+html: </abbr>
  should consider to use GPGME.  It is even planned to create a set of
  standard widgets for common key selection tasks.
