* Donate - Thank you

  *Thank you very much for your donation to our work on GnuPG.*

  We will update the [[file:kudos.org][list of donors]] once a week, thus you won’t see
  your name immediately.  If you did not give a name you won’t be
  listed at all.

  Here is our transaction data of your payment:
