In 2016 we had 268 individual donations summing up to 9615 Euro, we

Euro, and 60000 USD (54220 Euro) from the Linux Foundation.

In 2015 we had 5844 individual donations summing up to 205560 Euro
(193692 net), we received 50000 USD each from Facebook and Stripe
resulting in 89846 Euro, and 60000 USD (54416 Euro) from the Linux
Foundation.

In 2014 we had 901 individual donations dumming up to 34700 Euro
(30305 net).  Some of the donations have been hold back by Stripe over
the end of the year and thus VAT was only payable in 2015.  That VAT
is not included in the net amount for 2014.  The net amount received
from individual donations in 2014 have been 2525, 919, 541, 26320 Euro
per quarter.

In 2013 the [[https://gnupg.org/blog/20140512-rewards-sent.html][Goteo]] campaign raised 32641 Euro (27429 net) in December.
Goteo transferred that money in March 2014 in 6 chunks: 11423, 6000,
5000, 5000, 5218.  The total amount is however listed for 2013 along
with 148 individual donations of 5041 Euro (4041 net) received before
the start of the Goteo campaign.

*** Monthly donations stats since 2017

This is a summary of individual donations since 2017.  After the
campaign boost in June and July 2017 we can conclude that a majority
of the received donations are now reccurring (either monthly,
quarterly or yearly).  The outlier in December 2017 is a single large
donation of 5000 Euro.
