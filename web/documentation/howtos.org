** GnuPG SmartcardHOWTO

   GnuPG supports the use of smartcards.  This HOWTO explains how to
   install and work with these cards.

   - as on-line browsable HTML files ( [[../howtos/card-howto/en/smartcard-howto.html][en]] )
   - as one big HTML file ( [[../howtos/card-howto/en/smartcard-howto-single.html][en]] )

   This smartcard howto is also available in the [[file:~/s/gnupg-web/web/download/cvs_access.org][source repository]].

** PGP5-GnuPG HOWTO

   If you have problems exchanging messages with a PGP 5.x system, you
   should have a look at this [[http://technocage.com/~caskey/gnupg/pgp2gnupg.html][PGP5-GnuPG HOWTO]] available in English
   only.  Note that PGP 5 is heavily out of date and should not be
   used.

** GnuPG Keysigning Party HOWTO

   Once you get familiar with GnuPG's mechanisms, you surely wouldn't
   miss one of its funnest (and useful) aspects: to meet your Internet
   buddies and get your key signed by as many of them as possible.

   But having to check tens or even hundreds of keys at a meeting may
   become quite frustrating. Here it is where this HOWTO by V. Alex
   Brennen comes in handy. It is a guide to understanding and
   organizing a PGP keysigning party. Keysigning parties help build
   and strengthen the web of trust which serves to make the use of
   GnuPG more secure.

   This HOWTO is available:

   -  as an on-line browsable set of HTML files (

** Mutt-GnuPG HOWTO

   Firstly, because everyone should be using encryption and signatures
   in their email. Secondly, because there are absolutely no reason
   for you not to be using PGP-compatible software. Thirdly, because
   documentation is mostly geared toward someone who is already
   familiar with PGP.  Fourtly, because we like to promote both GnuPG
   and Mutt as free software project, for use in everyday
   communications. Lastly, because Justin R.  Miller likes writing
   tutorials.

   For all these reasons, you can find below a link to Justin's HOWTO
   on how to send and receive cryptographically signed and/or
   encrypted email with GnuPG and the [[http://www.mutt.org/][Mutt mail reader]].

   This HOWTO is available:

   -  as plain text ( [[http://codesorcery.net/old/mutt/][en]] )
