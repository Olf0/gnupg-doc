* What’s new in GnuPG 2.1

GnuPG version 2.1 comes with a bag of new features which changes some
things old-timers are used to.  This page explains the more important
ones.  It expects that the user is somewhat familiar with GnuPG
version 2.0 and is aware that GnuPG consists of /gpg/, /gpgsm/, and
/gpg-agent/ as its main components.

- The file /secring.gpg/ is not anymore used to store the secret keys.
  Merging of secret keys is now supported.

- All support for /PGP-2 keys/ has been removed for security reasons.

- Support for /Elliptic Curve Cryptography/ (ECC) is now available

- The standard key generation interface is much leaner now to help the
  new user creating a suitable key.

- Commands to create and sign keys from the command line without any
  extra prompts are now available.

- The Pinentry dialog may now show two fields to enter a new
  passphrase and a confirmation of it.

- There is no more need to manually start the gpg-agent.  It is now
  started by any part of GnuPG as needed.

- Problems with importing keys with the same long key id have been
  addressed.

- The /dirmngr/ is now part of GnuPG proper and also takes care of
  accessing keyserver.

- Keyserver pools are now handled in a smarter way.

- A new format for locally storing the public keys is now used.  This
  considerable speeds up operations on large keyrings.

- /Revocation certificates/ are now created by default.

- Card support has been updated, new readers and token types are
  supported.

- The format of the key listing has been changed to better identify
  the properties of a key.

- The gpg-agent may now be used on Windows as /pageant/ replacement
  for /putty/ in the same way it is used for years on Unix as
  /ssh-agent/ replacement.

- Creation of X.509 certificates has been improved.  It is now also
  possible to export them directly in PKCS#8 and PEM format for use on
  TLS servers.

- The scripts to create a Windows installer is now part of GnuPG.
