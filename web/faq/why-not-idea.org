#+TITLE: GnuPG - Why not IDEA

* Update

  Note that the IDEA patent has expired and IDEA is now directly
  supported since GnuPG 1.4.13 respective 2.x with Libgcrypt 1.6.  The
  use of IDEA is not suggested due to its short block length and it is
  only provided to allow decryption of archived data.

  The section below is thus only of historic interest.


* Why not IDEA

   IDEA is a patented algorithm and therefore the use of IDEA in
   countries where this patent is valid can not be allowed due to
   restrictions in the GNU General Public License. Those restrictions are
   there to help protecting the freedom of software.

   For more information on the nonsense of software patents and the
   general problem with this, please see [[www.noepatents.org]].

   If you still want to use IDEA and you are legally allowed to do so,
   you can download the [[ftp://ftp.gnupg.dk/contrib-dk/idea.c.gz][idea.c.gz]] file and its [[ftp://ftp.gnupg.dk/contrib-dk/idea.c.gz.sig][signature]] , read
   the instructions at the top of the file, compile it and use it as a
   plugin for GnuPG. But please do us all a favor and use it only for
   decrypting. CAST5 and AES are good and patent unencumbered algorithms
   which don't bear any interoperability problems.

   Windows user might be interested in the [[ftp://ftp.gnupg.dk/contrib-dk/ideadll.zip][precompiled DLL]] and its
   [[ftp://ftp.gnupg.dk/contrib-dk/ideadll.zip.sig][signature]].
