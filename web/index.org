GnuPG is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard as
defined by [[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4880.txt][RFC4880]] (also known as /PGP/). GnuPG allows to encrypt and
sign your data and communication, features a versatile key management
system as well as access modules for all kinds of public key
directories. GnuPG, also known as /GPG/, is a command line tool with
features for easy integration with other applications. A wealth of
[[file:related_software/frontends.html][frontend applications]] and [[file:related_software/libraries.html][libraries]] are available. Version 2 of GnuPG
also provides support for S/MIME and Secure Shell (ssh).

GnuPG is [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html][Free Software]] (meaning that it respects your freedom). It can
be freely used, modified and distributed under the terms of the
[[https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html][GNU General Public License]] .

GnuPG comes in three flavours:

 - {{{gnupg21_ver}}} is the /modern/ version with support
   for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography][ECC]] and many other new features,

 - {{{gnupg_ver}}} is the /stable/ version which is currently mostly
   used.

 - and {{{gnupg1_ver}}} is the /classic/ portable version.

Project [[https://www.gpg4win.org][Gpg4win]] provides a Windows version of GnuPG /stable/. It is
nicely integrated into an installer and features several frontends as
well as English and German manuals.  A simple Windows installer for the
/modern/ version is available at our [[file:download/index.org][download]] page.

# * Reconquer your privacy
#
# Even if you have nothing to hide, using encryption helps protect the
# privacy of people you communicate with, and makes life difficult for
# bulk surveillance systems. If you do have something important to hide,
# you are in good company; GnuPG is one of the tools that Edward Snowden
# used to uncover the secrets of the NSA.
#
# Please visit the [[https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org][Email Self-Defense]] site to learn how and why you
# should use GnuPG for your electronic communication.  If you need
# printed leaflets check out [[https://fsfe.org/contribute/spreadtheword.html#gnupg-leaflet][FSFE’s GnuPG leaflet]].


* Join us for the first OpenPGP conference

#+html: <a href="/conf/index.html"><img style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;" src="/conf/images/openpgp-conf.png" alt="Logo: OpenPGP.conf" /></a>

[[https://www.gnupg.org/conf/index.html][OpenPGP.conf]] is a conference for users and implementers of the OpenPGP
protocol, which is at the core of GnuPG.  We meet in Cologne on
September 8 and 9.  [[https://www.gnupg.org/conf/index.html][OpenPGP.conf]] is a place to meet, discuss, and
learn about latest developments of GnuPG and other OpenPGP aware
applications and what technical measures can be deployed to repel the
ever increasing trend to mass surveillance.

* A big Thanks to all supporters

Due to this [[http://www.propublica.org/article/the-worlds-email-encryption-software-relies-on-one-guy-who-is-going-broke][ProPublica article]] we received more than 120,000 \euro of
individual donations on a single day.  There was even more: The [[http://www.linuxfoundation.org/programs/core-infrastructure-initiative][Core
Infrastructure Initiative]] granted 60,000 $ for 2015.  Our payment
service [[https://twitter.com/stripe/status/563449352635432960][Stripe]] and [[https://www.facebook.com/notes/protect-the-graph/supporting-gnu-privacy-guard/1564591893780956][Facebook]] will each give 50,000 $ to the project.
And finally the [[https://www.wauland.de/en/donation.html#61][Wau Holland Stiftung]] is collecting tax deductible
funds for GnuPG (19000 \euro plus 57 BTC).

As the main author of GnuPG, I like to thank everyone for supporting
the project, be it small or large individual donations, helping users,
providing corporate sponsorship, working on the software, and for all
the encouraging words.

GnuPG does not stand alone: there are many other projects, often
unknown to most people, which are essential to keep the free Internet
running.  Many of them are run by volunteers who spend a lot of unpaid
time on them.  They need our support as well.
