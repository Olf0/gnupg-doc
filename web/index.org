GnuPG is the [[http://www.gnu.org/][GNU project]]'s complete and free implementation of the
OpenPGP standard as defined by [[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4880.txt][RFC4880]]. GnuPG allows to encrypt and
sign your data and communication, features a versatile key management
system as well as access modules for all kinds of public key
directories. GnuPG, also known as /GPG/, is a command line tool with
features for easy integration with other applications. A wealth of
[[related_software/frontends.html][frontend applications]] and [[related_software/libraries.html][libraries]] are available. Version 2 of GnuPG
also provides support for S/MIME.

GnuPG is [[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html][Free Software]] (meaning that it respects your freedom). It can
be freely used, modified and distributed under the terms of the [[http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html][GNU
General Public License]] .

GnuPG comes in two flavours: [[download][{{{gnupg1_ver}}}]] is the well known and
portable standalone version, whereas [[download][{{{gnupg_ver}}}]] is the enhanced
and somewhat harder to build version.

Project [[http://www.gpg4win.org][Gpg4win]] provides a Windows version of GnuPG. It is nicely
integrated into an installer and features several frontends as well as
English and German manuals.

Project [[http://gpgtools.org][GPGTools]] provides a Mac OS X version of GnuPG. It is nicely
integrated into an installer and features all required tools.

Project [[http://www.gnupg.org/aegypten/][Aegypten]] developed the S/MIME functionality in GnuPG 2.
