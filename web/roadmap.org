* GnuPG Roadmap
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: gnupg
  :END:

  This page has information on what we plan to do and what new
  features will go into which version.  This is _not_ a list of
  guaranteed milestones or with fixed release dates.  This page should
  better be viewed as a scratchpad with notes of GnuPG developers.

  The next GnuPG /modern/ release will be 2.1.11 and is planned for
  early January but may be released sooner in case 2.1.10 shows too
  many problems.


** All things to do for 2.1

 - +Fix flaws in HKPS support+

 - +Add LDAP keyserver support+

 - +Add unattended key generation with passphrase.+

 - +More and more bug reports are coming in.  Decide which of them to+
   +fix for 2.1.2.+

 - +Migrate everything to automake 1.14.+

 - +Add Tor support+

 - Add a status-fd interface for the new Tofu system

 - Release Libgcrypt 1.7 so that Curve25519 ECDH will work (see below)

 - Finish NTBTLS to allow for TLS access to LDAP and HKP on Windows.


** Required for GPGME

 - Add specific trust information for Tofu

 - Add API to set the tofu policy for a key


** Documentation items

 - Write an I-D to describe Curve25519 ECDH


** RFC work

 - Push RFC-2440bis forward


* Libgcrypt Roadmap
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: gcrypt
  :END:

  Libgcrypt is used by a lot of other projects and thus deserves its
  own roadmap


** Things to be done for Libgcrypt 1.7

   The next release will be 1.7 with a lot of performance improvements
   and a few new features. Here are the things we want to have before
   the 1.7.0 release:

 - +Add OCB mode+
 - Update of the Windows entropy gatherer (rndw32.c)


   The rndw32 update is pretty important because it has not seen any
   updates for years.  We need to compare the code against the latest
   Cryptlib.  Updating rndunix could also be done but it is not very
   important given that all mainstream OS now feature a /dev/random.

* Infrastructure

** Web

 - Auto build the pages on the server

 - Add RSS feed for the blogs

** BTS

 - Migrate Roundup from Sqlite to Postgres so speed it up.  The
   assumption is that we have more concurrent users which slows all
   things down.

** Hardware

 - We need more disk space for Thrithemius and best also more RAM.

 - Playfair has only 2GiB RAM assigned which considerably slows it
   down as soon as ill behaving spiders access it.

** Software

 - Add an option to pound(1) to limit concurrent conections
   (cf. playfair load due to spiders)

 - Add a 404 handler to Boa (I started with that in my local repo -
   wk).
