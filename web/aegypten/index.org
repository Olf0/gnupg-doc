#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The Sphinx project launched by German authorities aims to improve
  secure email exchange. The projects technological base is the protocol
  'TeleTrust e.V. MailTrusT Version 2'. This includes the standards
  S/MIME, X.509v3 and others.

  Proprietary products are already on the way, but with the project
  *Ägypten* there is now also a Free Software solution going to be
  realized for popular mail user agents (sphinx-enabling *KMail* and
  *Mutt* are essential goals).

  The Free Software companies Intevation, g10 Code and Klarälvdalens
  Datakonsult AB are contracted by the German 'Bundesamt für Sicherheit
  in der Informationstechnik (BSI)' to incorporate the Sphinx protocols
  into Free Software MUAs. Background is to ensure availability of
  alternatives to proprietary desktops.

** Aims and Results

Within this project it is an explicit goal to produce sustainable
improvements for the free software desktop and no quickly assembled
code. The outcome of Ägypten consists of modular contributions to
existing projects (there will be no single Ägypten package). These work
together as an integrated solution for the users.

Rough list of aims and results:

-  Plug-In for KMail and Mutt (established)
-  LDAP support for Certificate Revocation Lists, CRLs (established)
-  incorporation of sphinx protocols in gpg framework (established)
-  X.509, PKCS10, PKCS11, PKCS12 and PKCS15 support (established)
-  parallel support of OpenPGP for KMail (established)
-  LDAP support for KMail address book (established)
-  All finished by summer 2002, alpha-version for CeBIT 2002, Hannover
   (official completion was on 27-November-2002)

Detailed list of results:

-  All improvements and new modules are integrated into the
   corresponding main developments (CVS HEAD) if not noted otherwise.
-  *KMail*: All modifications to KMail (adding PGP/MIME and S/MIME
   support) are officially available since KDE 3.1 release.
-  *Mutt*: A modified version based on 1.5.0 is available as a special
   package. Changes for a more flexible approach for different
   crypto-backends has been integrated into Mutt CVS HEAD. Eventually,
   the Ägypten patch may go into the CVS HEAD as well.
-  *KAddressbook*: LDAP support is added and available since KDE 3.1.
-  *KGpgCertmanager*: A new KDE application to manage the certificates
   through a GUI. Available since KDE 3.1.
-  *NewPG*: A new module that covers GpgSM (S/MIME encryption and
   key-management) and SCDaemon (for Smartcard access). This module will
   eventually be merged with GnuPG.
-  *Pinentry*: A new module that contains various interfaces (qt, gtk,
   curses, terminal) to enter a PIN/passphrase.
-  *DirMngr*: A new module that handles the Certificate Revocation Lists
   (CRLs).
-  *GpgME*: Extended to handle GnuPG (OpenPGP) and GpgSM (S/MIME)
   concurrently. Also a comprehensive documentation was written to
   support sphinx-enabling further MUAs.
-  *GnuPG*: Extended with GpgAgent that stores passphrases like
   ssh-agent does (available since GnuPG 1.2.0 release).
-  *cryptplug*: This new module is an optional interface layer between
   GpgME and a MUA. It is used for KMail, Mutt is directly coupled with
   GpgME.
