The 59.000 â‚¬ from the Wau Holland Stiftung have been collected by them
for the GnuPG project since 2013.  After the Verein reached charitable
state they were able to transfer that money.  Many thanks to them.

We have produced two kinds of postcards to be used as giveaways at
shows and other opportunities.
