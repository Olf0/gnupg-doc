* Links About Cryptography

  Nowadays, privacy is becoming a primary concern for everyone. Here
  it is a non-comprehensive list of [[#sites][sites]] and projects (both [[#sw-prj][software]]
  and [[#hw-prj][hardware]]) about cryptography.

** Crypto-Based Software Projects
#  <<sw-prj>>

-  [[http://www.bifroest.demon.co.uk/ctc/][CTC]] :: CTC is another free encryption tool.
-  [[http://gnutls.org][GNUTLS]] :: A somewhat related project to GnuPG is GNUTLS which is is
             a GPLed TLS/SSL implementation under development.
-  [[http://www.net.lut.ac.uk/psst/][psst]] :: It is a project to create a free ssh/sshd
           replacement. Niels MÃ¶ller has meanwhile released the
           software under the name LSH.
-  [[http://www.franken.de/crypt/scez.html][SCEZ]] :: SCEZ is a project to access Smartcards under GNU/Linux.
-  [[http://www1.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/secfone/][secfone]] :: Project on secure telephoning.


** Crypto-Based Hardware Projects
#  <<hw-prj>>

-  [[http://www.ibutton.com/][iButton]] :: A pretty neat device.
-  [[http://willware.net:8080/hw-rng.html][Will Ware]] :: A cheap random source would be a nice thing. Will Ware
                describes such a devices and has links to other
                sources. It could be a nice idea to combine that with
                a DCF77 receiver (atomic clock).
