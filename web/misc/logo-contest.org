* New Logo Contest

  Below you find the announcement of the logo contest we held in
  autumn 2006. The final logo has meanwhile be selected and is in
  actual use. For a list of submissions (some are really great) and
  sponsors, please point your browser to [[http://logo-contest.gnupg.org/][logo-contest.gnupg.org]].

  After 8 years the time has come to modernize the GnuPG Logo and to work
  on a new layout of the website.

  We appreciate Thomas LÃ¶ffelholz's Gnus-guarding-the-door logo which has
  served us for a long time. However, GnuPG has moved forward and is not
  anymore a plain OpenPGP application but features other protocols as well
  (S/MIME and partly Secure Shell). Further, the current logo is too
  detailed to be used as an icon or to be printed on a t-shirt. Thus we
  want to have a new modern logo.

  To get to such a logo we try something new: We ask you to donate to the
  logo contest and then offer the collected funds to the winner of that
  contest.

  Here are the rules for the contest:

  -  Submissions should be send by mail to logo-contest at gnupg dot org.
     Sending just an URL is recommended. At least one PNG scaled to 300
     pixel height or width is required. Sending a design concept is
     appreciated.
  -  The design should convey the message of freedom and privacy. It must
     not exploit or offend anyone's sex, race or religion, be obscene or
     propagate violence.
  -  The logo shall be available in a free format (bitmap or vector) and
     eventually made available in source form, modifiable using Free
     Software (xcf, fig, etc.). The submitter's name and snail mail
     address is required for exchanging legal papers.
  -  The winning submitter must agree to assign the copyright to the FSF
     and attach no other restrictions to the use of the logo. All
     submitters must declare that they do not infringe the rights of
     another party and that publishing their logos for the purpose of this
     contest is acceptable.
  -  The contest ran until October 31, 2006. A jury will then select the
     winning submission. The winner will receive 50% of the collected
     funds. The three top rated submitters are eligible for a gnupg dot
     org mail alias.
  -  All contributors to GnuPG who signed a copyright assignment with the
     FSF, actually provided code or translations and do not participate in
     the contest make up the jury to decide on the new logo. The file
     AUTHORS in the GnuPG 1.4.5 tarball has a list of these folks. Simple
     majority is used to decide.

  Collecting and spending the donations:

  -  The donations are collected for the purpose of creating a logo and a
     new website layout.
  -  The winner of the logo contest will receive 50% of the collected
     funds. The leftover funds will be used for a follow-up contest to
     redesign and re-implement the website.
  -  A list of sponsors will be published after the final logo has been
     selected.
  -  In case that for unforeseeable reasons a winner could not be
     determined or we cannot spend the collected funds, they will be
     donated to the Free Software Foundation Europe.
  -  The funds are collected through Paypal online payment. For legal
     reasons and ease of setup they will be collected by g10 Code GmbH, a
     company headed by GnuPG's principal author Werner Koch. Note, that
     the tax office will likely require to transfer a 16% VAT, thus the
     collected funds need to be reduced by this amount. g10 Code will do a
     weekly report on the received funds as well as a final report after
     selection of the winner.

  (The donation form has been removed).
