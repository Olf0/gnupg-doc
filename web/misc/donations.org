  Maintaining and improving GnuPG is costly. For more than 10 years
  now, g10^code, a German company owned and headed by GnuPG's
  principal author Werner Koch, is bearing the majority of these
  costs. To help them carry on this work, they need your support.

  The donation page used to be hosted over at the g10^code GmbH site.
  Since May 2014 the donation page is a proper part of this site:
