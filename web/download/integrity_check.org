* Integrity Check

  In order to check that the version of GnuPG which you are going to
  install is an original and unmodified one, you can do it in one of
  the following ways.

** Using gpg

  If you already have a trusted version of GnuPG installed, you can
  simply check the supplied signature. For example to check the
  signature of the file =gnupg-{{{gnupg_ver}}}.tar.bz2= you would use
  this command:

#+begin_example
  gpg --verify gnupg-{{{gnupg_ver}}}.tar.bz2.sig
#+end_example

  This checks whether the signature file matches the source file. You
  should see a message indicating that the signature is good and made
  by that [[../signature_key.org][signing key]]. Make sure that you have the right key, either
  by checking the fingerprint of that key with other sources or by
  checking that the key has been signed by a trustworthy other key.

  *Never use a GnuPG version you just downloaded to check the
  integrity of the source* - use an existing GnuPG installation.

** Using sha1sum

   If you are not able to use an old version of GnuPG, you have to
   verify the SHA1 checksum. Assuming you downloaded the file
   =gnupg-{{{gnupg_ver}}}.tar.bz2=, you would run the =sha1sum=
   command like this:

#+begin_example
   sha1sum gnupg-{{{gnupg_ver}}}.tar.bz2
#+end_example

   and check that the output matches the SHA-1 checksum reported on
   this site. An example of a =sha1sum= output is:

#+begin_example
   {{{gnupg_sha1}}}  gnupg-{{{gnupg_ver}}}.tar.bz2
#+end_example

   To be sure that this page has not been tampered, you may want to
   compare the list below with the one included in the announcement
   mail posted to several mailing list.

** SHA-1 Sum Summary

   For your convenience, all SHA1 sums available for software that can
   be downloaded from [[ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/][our site]], have been gathered below.

#+begin_example
   {{{dirmngr_sha1}}}  dirmngr-{{{dirmngr_ver}}}.tar.bz2
   {{{gnupg1_patch_sha1}}}  gnupg-{{{gnupg1_patch_ver}}}.diff.bz2
   {{{gnupg1_sha1_gz}}}  gnupg-{{{gnupg1_ver}}}.tar.gz
   {{{gnupg1_sha1}}}  gnupg-{{{gnupg1_ver}}}.tar.bz2
   {{{gnupg1_w32cli_sha1}}}  gnupg-w32cli-{{{gnupg1_w32cli_ver}}}.exe
   {{{gnupg_sha1}}}  gnupg-{{{gnupg_ver}}}.tar.bz2
   {{{gpgme_sha1}}}  gpgme-{{{gpgme_ver}}}.tar.bz2
   {{{libassuan_sha1}}}  libassuan-{{{libassuan_ver}}}.tar.bz2
   {{{libgcrypt_sha1}}}  libgcrypt-{{{libgcrypt_ver}}}.tar.bz2
   {{{libgpg_error_sha1}}}  libgpg-error-{{{libgpg_error_ver}}}.tar.bz2
