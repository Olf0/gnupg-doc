* Release Notes

  Please read the NEWS file for a more complete list. {{{gnupg_ver}}
  is the stable and modern version of GnuPG. (Version {{{gnupg1_ver}}}
  is from the old GnuPG-1 series, which is still maintained and useful
  on some platforms: It is smaller than versions from the GnuPG-2
  series, easier to build and also better portable to ancient
  platforms. In contrast to GnuPG-2 it comes with no support for
  S/MIME, Secure Shell, or other tools useful for desktop
  environments.
