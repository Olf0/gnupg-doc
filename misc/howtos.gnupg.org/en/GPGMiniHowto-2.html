<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1</A> <A HREF="GPGMiniHowto.html#toc2.1">Sources for GnuPG.</A>
</H2>
<P>The official download site is:
<A HREF="http://www.gnupg.org/download.html">GnuPG Homepage</A>.
At that location you will find links to mirror sites.</P>
<P>Due to legal restrictions it is not allowed to download GnuPG from servers
based in the USA. The USA imposes export restrictions on the export of
cryptographic software. This is why PGP is always available in an international
and a national (for the USA) version.
For the international version the source code has been exported in a printed format
as a book. In Europe (Oslo) it has
been scanned. More information on that can be found on
<A HREF="http://www.pgpi.com/">International PGP Homepage</A>.
The international version of PGP is
free to be imported into the United States as long as it is not reexported again.</P>
<P>If you already have an installed version of GnuPG or PGP, you should check the
signature of the file (see
<A HREF="GPGMiniHowto-5.html#GPG-Minihowto-signatures">Signatures</A>).</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2</A> <A HREF="GPGMiniHowto.html#toc2.2">Configuration </A>
</H2>
<P>You can obtain GnuPG as a Debian Package, as a RPM package (Redhat Package Manager)
or in source code.
GnuPG is included in the latest Fedora/Redhat Linux distributions.
To check if you have GnuPG installed on your system, use:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
rpm -q gnupg
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The packages are installed as binary files with the
tools needed for Linux platforms. When you need GnuPG for different platforms
you need to compile this yourself. It would be appreciated when you make
alternative installation methods for different platforms available to the
general public. </P>
<P>Since development for the major part takes place with Linux (x86), translation to
different systems should not be regarded as being a problem. The actual list of
known operating systems that support GnuPG can be found on
<A HREF="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG Homepage</A>.
The procedure as described below is pretty platform independent. This procedure can
be used to install GnuPG out of a source code tar-ball.</P>
<P>Unpack the tar-ball with the following commands,
For sources compressed with gzip use:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
tar xvzf gnupg-?.?.?.tar.gz
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>and for sources compressed with bzip2 use:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
tar xvjf gnupg-?.?.?.tar.bz2
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>After the unpack, please step into the directory containing the source code.
Then type</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
./configure
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>When doing this nothing special should happen. With </P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
./configure --help
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>you can view the available configuration settings for compilation. If problems
occur that have to do with internationalization (gettext), you can include
a version that is delivered with the source code by using the option
<CODE>--with-included-gettext</CODE> or switch it of by using
the <CODE>--disable-NLS</CODE> option.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3</A> <A HREF="GPGMiniHowto.html#toc2.3">Compile </A>
</H2>
<P>After this we want to compile the stuff by typing:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
make
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
This should work without any problems. If any problems occur take the following
steps (in the same order as described here): First try to solve this yourself
(of course also by using the available documentation).
Then make sure that your problem is not a known bug (check the BUGS file on http://www.gnupg.org).
Then ask someone you know. If
these steps do not solve your problem post a question to the GnuPG-mailing list
(see
<A HREF="GPGMiniHowto-7.html#GPG-Minihowto-Informationsources">Informationsources</A>). If
the problem is path related, you should try <CODE>make clean</CODE>, then run
<CODE>configure</CODE> again and retry to compile. If that doesn't work it is
time to panic.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4</A> <A HREF="GPGMiniHowto.html#toc2.4">Installation</A>
</H2>
<P>Now type:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
to actually copy the program and the man-pages into the installation directory.
If you didn't change the installation directory when you did ./configure the
<CODE>usr/local/share/gnupg/</CODE> will be the installation directory. You can
find this directory in the file <CODE>options.skel</CODE>. When you change this
<CODE>options.skel</CODE>. If you copy this to <CODE>~/.gnupg/options</CODE> the
appropriate adjustments will be used as standard. Copying should occur
automatically when creating <CODE>~/.gnupg/</CODE>. All possible options are
well documented and explaining them here would not be useful.</P>
<P>You can run GnuPG as suid root. So the program runs with all the rights the
superuser has. By doing this you exclude the possibility that certain parts
of the program are stored externally and then could be read by anyone. It is
not feasible for me to judge on the value of this risk. But running the program
as suid root one should be alert to the danger of Trojan horses. Since a Trojan
horse running as superuser can damage an entire system. If for this reason (or
any other reason) you choose not run GnuPG as root you can switch off the warning
by setting
<CODE>no-secmem-warning</CODE> in <CODE>~/.gnupg/options</CODE>.</P>
