  <h2>Goteo Campaign: Preliminary Results</h2>
  </a>
  <h5>Posted May 12, 2014 by Werner</h5>

  <p>
  Here is a quick campaign status update: After the t-shirts arrived as
  expected the week after Eastern, Mechthilde, Michael, Penny, Rainer,
  and me met the other day at the FSFE office in Düsseldorf.  Due to
  Rainer’s excellent preparation we quickly folded, enveloped, and
  stamped about 300 t-shirts and snailed them.  Kudos to them for
  helping with this task.  There are still a few t-shirts we have not
  been able to sent because some of our contributors did not reply to
  several mails asking for missing address details, or the postmaster
  returned them due to faulty addresses.  If you expected a t-shirt and
  did not receive one, please contact me at accounts at GnuPG dot net.
  Most of the stickers have also been snailed but a few are still
  pending due to uncertain addresses.
  </p>

  <p>
  The main <a href="https://www.gnupg.org">GnuPG site</a> is now
  accessible via TLS and plain http access is redirected to the https
  address.  Strict Transport Security (HSTS) has also been enabled.
  In the case of problems with TLS the site may still be accessed
  non-encrypted via
  <a href="http://www.tla-friendly.gnupg.org">http://www.tla-friendly.gnupg.org</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  To accomplish another promise of the campaign, the website may now be
  accessed as TOR hidden service at
  <a href="http://ic6au7wa3f6naxjq.onion">http://ic6au7wa3f6naxjq.onion</a>. Being
  a well known and intentionally public site, it does not make much
  sense to have it as a hidden service.  However, if the site is to be
  accessed anyway via Tor we can avoid the extra TLS layer and and
  allow direct access.  Note that lists.gnupg.org and some other
  services are not available via an onion address.
  </p>

  <p>
  Finally here are preliminary financial results of the campaign:
  </p>

  <p>
  Our contributors donated a total of 37270 Euro. Due to card and
  Paypal processing problems we actually received 36732 Euro.  The
  preliminary costs for running the campaign are 18590 Euros, so
  that 18142 Euro are available for the goals.  Here is an overview
  of the costs:

  Due to missing or incomplete addresses or no response to our mails
  we could not ship about 80 stickers and 15 t-shirts.  I spend a
  substantial amount of time (at least 4 weeks) with direct campaign
  related tasks, which were not included in the original plan.  That
  plan explained how to spend the money:

  campaign, and for some giveaways to long time GnuPG hackers.

			<p>After 50 days of crowdfunding, the <a href="http://goteo.org/project/gnupg-new-website-and-infrastructure" target="blank">GnuPG campaign</a> for new website and infrastructure will close tomorrow. That means rewards for backers can now be ordered and preparations for dispatch can begin. Here are the results so far:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>36.741 EUR raised out of 24.000 target</li>
				<li>1.081 people donated in support</li>
				<li>350 EUR Largest single donation</li>
				<li>33 EUR average donation</li>
				<li>365 Stickers claimed</li>
				<li>300 T-shirts claimed</li>
				<li>191 GnuPG email addresses claimed</li>
				<li>793 Additional Twitter followers (from 60)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Goteo, the Free Software platform hosting the campaign, usually required two 40 day rounds of funding, but in our case we're ending early, after just 50 days. This will enable us to deliver the new site and GnuPG 2.1 faster, and is possible thanks to reaching our goal so quickly (in just 26 hours).</p>

			<p>We're currently preparing a system for collecting donor preferences for their rewards (sizes, addresses, etc.), so expect to be contacted in the next week or two if that includes you.</p>

			<p>Thanks again to all our backers for the overwhelming support that GnuPG has received!</p>

			<h2>How good is Goteo? An appraisal</h2>
		</a>
		<h5>Posted 30th December 2013 by Sam Tuke</h5>

		<div class="captioned-img right" style="margin-top:0;">
			<img width="380px" src="img/goteo-pledge-wall.png" />
			<p>A wall of donor faces on Goteo</p>
		</div>

		<p>"One question: why did you choose the quite unknown Spanish crowdfunding site Goteo?" So shot back the reply to the <a href="http://blog.gnupg.org/20131219-gnupg-launches-crowfunding.html" target="blank">press release</a> I had just sent to a few dozen selected journalists announcing the launch of the GnuPG crowdfunding campaign. "You won't get any exposure on there, we got a few hundred thousand hits just from being on indiegogo" I was told by one experienced crowdfunder at my favourite <a href="http://www.c-base.org/" target="blank" rel="nofollow">Berlin hackerspace</a> last month. "What's Goteo?" has been one of the most frequently asked questions of this campaign from friends and supporters.</p>

		<p>I ummed and ahhed over which crowfunding platform to choose. It's a decision that has a huge impact on the campaign - market exposure, transaction costs, and design and layout are just a few of the many factors that have to be taken into account. This is a crowded market - new crowdfunding sites are popping up each week as more companies try to cash in on what is recognised a key <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/23/tech-128-from-airbnb-to-crowdfunding-the-year-in-review" target="blank" rel="nofollow">tech trend of 2013</a>. An <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/23/crowdfunding-limitations" target="blank" rel="nofollow">estimated $5bn</a> was raised by crowdfunders this year. That equates to around $35m in commission fees for the platforms hosting these campaigns, who typically charge between <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/indiegogo-faq" title="indiegogo's commission charges" target="blank" rel="nofollow">5</a>-<a href="http://goteo.org/faq/sponsor#q98"
		title="Goteo's commission Charges" target="blank">10%</a>. It's no surprise that everyone wants a slice.</p>

		<div class="captioned-img left">
			<img width="180px" src="img/non-economic-goteo.png" />
			<p>"Non-economic donations"</p>
		</div>

		<p>Goteo however, is unique. Right now it's the only crowdfunding software that is itself <a href="https://fsfe.org/about/basics/freesoftware.en.html" target="blank">Free Software</a>, allowing everyone to inspect how it works and run their own copy. Even though I don't plan to run my own Kickstarter competitor any time soon, the fact we can check its code, make improvements, and follow the development process is really important. I want Goteo to prosper profitably because, aside from all its other good points, I know some of that profit will be invested in the platform itself, which shall remain free and accessible to everyone under the terms of the <a href="https://github.com/Goteo/Goteo/blob/master/GNU-AGPL-3.0" target="blank" rel="nofollow">AGPL3 license</a>.</p>

		<p>Goteo is also the only such site to my knowledge that's built with public money. Funded by Spain's Department for Education, Culture and Sport, Barcelona's City Council, and The University of Andalucia, Goteo exists to host projects which "<a href="http://goteo.org/about" target="blank">contribute to the common good, free knowledge, and open code</a>". Everything about the platform and the projects it hosts point to common goods, shared resources, and collaborative effort.</p>

		<p>Besides that, these other features make it stand out:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Signup and donation workflow is smooth and simple</li>
			<li>Great focus on social media and sharing links (we had hundreds of tweets from these)</li>
			<li>Users can login with many social networks, including OpenID and LinkedIn</li>
			<li>Clean and professional design with easy access to key information</li>
			<li>Built in license chooser for all "goods" projects produce (categories for software, artwork, etc.)</li>
			<li>Mandatory delivery timeframe / deadline setter with public calendar</li>
			<li>Nice "image wall widget" of donors faces has potential, provides public recognition of donations</li>
			<li>Web forms for project creation are comprehensive and well designed</li>
			<li>Crowdsourcing of extra skills ("non-economic donations") works well</li>
			<li>Donations are guaranteed by PayPal and Goteo, not pledged or retractable</li>
			<li>Goteo staff are friendly and knowledgable, providing personal guidance and assistance</li>
			<li>Many funding successes, including a few related to <a href="http://goteo.org/project/bhoreal" target="blank" rel="nofollow">hardware</a>, <a href="http://goteo.org/project/smart-citizen-sensores-ciudadanos?lang=en" target="blank" rel="nofollow">software</a>, and <a href="http://goteo.org/project/protolab-movil" target="blank" rel="nofollow">Hackerspaces</a></li>
		</ul>

		Many of those benefits are obvious before launching a campaign. However, on the list of problems I experienced with the platform, most weren't discovered until the point of execution (<span class="orange-text">orange</span> = fix in progress):

		<ul>
			<li class="orange-text">User-set passwords are automatically emailed in plain text after registration (insecure)</li>
			<li>Rewards can't be customised, e.g. select t-shirt size</li>
			<li class="orange-text">Once a campaign is launched, no aspect can be edited directly (though news can be added)</li>
			<li>The order of images for the campaign page is random - the first image visitors see can't be specified</li>
			<li class="orange-text">The launch date of the campaign is chosen by Goteo administrators, it can't be specified</li>
			<li>No markup is available for text formatting</li>
			<li class="orange-text">Pictures are limited and can't be placed between text to break up the page</li>
			<li>There's a bug that causes double posting of news items</li>
			<li>Shipping for rewards is not configurable - international shipping can't be billed</li>
			<li>The website is not mobile friendly (minimum page width is 940px)</li>
			<li>HTTPS is not available to donors for transferring personal details</li>
		</ul>

		Besides that, I spotted a few opportunities for improvement:

		<ul>
			<li>Send emails to people who didn't complete their donation ("abandoned carts" - indiegogo does this)</li>
			<li>Allow managers to specify the content of social media messages</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="captioned-img right">
			<img width="400px" src="img/goteo-github-license.png" />
			<p>Goteo's license on GitHub</p>
		</div>

		<p>Some of the problems listed are a real pain. Because I couldn't choose the launch date, and hadn't planned for an in-depth human review by Goteo, our project went public days later than I expected, at a time when I was travelling and without connectivity. Goteo's campaigns team is helpful and responsive however, and even in the last few weeks several translation problems have been fixed which I had previously reported. I'm confident that the other most serious issues will be addressed in a timely manner.</p>

		<p>In all, we took a gamble by using Goteo, but one that paid off. It's focus on communal work and rewards is unique amongst its competitors, and when it comes to copyleft licensing they stand alone in practicing what they preach. Nearly all the convenient features that you'd expect from more established platforms are included, together with a pleasant functional interface. Donations are worry-free for both donors and recipients (though I can't comment on the final transfer process until later next month).</p>

		<p>Best of all perhaps, staff at Goteo are knowledgable and supportive and have time to invest in making projects a success. And when launch day comes and you're expecting the unexpected, that's very reassuring.</p>

		><h2>16 Years of protecting privacy</h2></a>
		<h5>Posted 20th December 2013 by Sam Tuke</h5>

		<p>
		Today marks 16 years since the first release of GNU Privacy Guard
		(GnuPG). In that time the project has grown from being a hacker’s
		hobby into one of the world’s most critical anti-surveillance
		tools. Today GnuPG stands at the front line of the battle between
		invasive surveillance and civil liberties.
		</p>

		<p>
		“Time has proven <a href="http://fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/4freedoms.en.html">Free Software</a> to be the most trustworthy defender
		against companies and governments seeking to undermine citizen
		privacy” said Werner Koch, GnuPG Founder and Lead Developer. “Although
		funding our work has not always been easy, the need for universally
		accessible privacy tools has never been more apparent”.
		</p>

		<p>
		Some of the world’s top security specialists are now counted among
		GnuPG users, including Bruce Schneier, Jacob Appelbaum, and Phil
		Zimmerman, inventor of PGP. This summer the world learned of the
		extent of Government spying thanks to whistleblowers and journalists
		communicating using GnuPG encrypted emails. Market leading servers
		from Red Hat and Debian have built their reputation for security on
		the foundation of GnuPG-verified software.
		</p>

		<p>
		“The success of GnuPG’s
		first <a href="http://goteo.org/project/gnupg-new-website-and-infrastructure"
		>crowdfunding campaign</a>, which received 90% of it’s target in 24
		hours, shows a fresh willingness among users to support GnuPG in it’s
		16th year, and points to new opportunities for the project in future”
		said Sam Tuke, GnuPG Campaign Manager.  “The release of GnuPG 2.1 and
		the launch of a newly designed website later this year will bring
		GnuPG and its clients for Windows, Mac, Gnu/Linux, and Android to new
		audiences”.
		</p>

		<p>
		Over the years GnuPG has kept up to date with new algorithms, such as
		Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and reactive to new threats, such as key
		extraction via acoustic monitoring, which was announced two days ago
		by researchers as GnuPG updates were released, in coordination with
		developers. Members remain confident of the future of GnuPG and look
		forward to facing the privacy threats of tomorrow with community
		support.

		><h2>Press release: GnuPG encryption project launches crowdfunding
		campaign</h2></a>
		<h5>Posted 19th December 2013 by Sam Tuke</h5>


		<p>Today GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) has launched its first
		<a href="http://goteo.org/project/gnupg-new-website-and-infrastructure"
		>crowdfunding campaign</a> with the aim of building a new
		website and long term infrastructure. The 24.000 EUR target will
		fund:</p>

		<ul>
		<li>Fresh web interfaces for gnupg.org including mobile</li>
		<li>Completion and release of GnuPG 2.1</li>
		<li>Anonymous Tor network access to the website</li>
		<li>A new user friendly download page suitable for all devices</li>
		<li>A new server for web services</li>
		<li>New pages convening external guides, videos, and handbooks</li>
		<li>Facilities for processing recurring donations for long
		term project support</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Project founder and Lead Developer Werner Koch said “GnuPG has
		seen a huge upsurge in popularity following recent state
		spying revelations. After 16 years of continuous development,
		we are now asking for community support to capitalise on
		consumer demand for privacy, and make GnuPG easy to access for
		mainstream audiences”.</p>

		<p>GnuPG is one of the few tools remaining above suspicion in the
		wake of leaked NSA documents. Edward Snowden and his contacts
		including Bruce Schneier switched to GnuPG when they began handling
		the secret
		documents <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-how-to-remain-secure-surveillance">earlier
		this year</a>. The Wall Street Journal, The Committee to Protect
		Journalists,
		and <a href="http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/hacks_hackers_security_for_jou.php">ProPublica</a>
		have all embraced GnuPG for protection of staff and sources. Phil
		Zimmermann, original inventor of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), has also
		moved to GnuPG in wake of the news.</p>

		<p>“GnuPG is a key part of modern privacy infrastructure” said
		Sam Tuke, Campaign Manager, GnuPG. “Millions of users rely on
		GnuPG to work securely on servers, laptops and smartphones,
		but 2013 donations totaling 3.000 EUR to date have not even
		covered fixed costs. Supporting new algorithms like elliptical
		curve and fixing newfound exploits fast takes a lot of work
		which is done voluntarily. Now is the time for people to
		contribute to making GnuPG slick and more sustainable in
		future”.</p>

		<p>Jacob Appelbaum, Tor Project developer, added “GnuPG is
		important - it allows us the assurances we need to do our
		work. Community funding is a critical part of a confident
		outlook for GnuPG in future.”</p>

		<p>The targets are set, the rewards are prepared, the press release
		has been edited and translated, and now we’re waiting for
		approval from the crowdfunding
		platform <a href="http://goteo.org/">Goteo</a>.</p>

		<p>Goteo is like indiegogo, but more forward thinking. It has a

		<p>Every ’good’ produced by a campaign on Goteo, be it artwork,
		software, event, or manufactured product, has a license assigned
		to it, like GPL or Creative Commons, and as well as asking for
		money, projects ask for other forms of help called “non-economic
		needs”, like translations or product
		testing.  Goteo’s <a href="https://github.com/Goteo/Goteo">own
		source</a> code is Free Software too, meaning anyone can run
		their own Goteo crowdfunding server. That’s the feature that
		swung our decision to use it for GnuPG.</p>


			<p>Because the type of project on Goteo is quite specific
			however, the acceptance phase of launching crowdfunding is
			taking us longer than expected. Right now we’re working with
			Goteo’s small team to answer questions which aren’t on the
			webforms you fill out when you design your project with their
			system.</p>

			<p>I’m hoping to provide what’s necesasry and get acceptance
			quickly. As soon as we have it the crowdfunding will launch
			and <a href="http://gnupg.hosted.phplist.com/lists/?p=subscribe&id=1"
			>newsletter</a> subscribers
			and <a href="https://twitter.com/gnupg">Twitter</a> followers
			will be the first to know.</p>

		[...]  To check how the forthcoming version 1.6.0 of Libgcrypt
		compares to the older 1.5 version of Libgcrypt, I did some benchmarks
		using a Thinkpad X220 which features an i5-2410M processor at 2.3GHz

		<p>Mid December, giving season, and nearly time for the GnuPG
		Crowdfunding to commence. We've been working hard on
		preparations. Drafts of the new mobile website design have been  published and met positive feedback, and a community-contibuted
		promo video was posted on YouTube. GnuPG coverage on Twitter
		continues to grow with many articles
		(<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/nov/29/surveillance-online-campaigning-tips">The
		Guardian</a>, <a href="http://usblog.kaspersky.com/gpg-strong-encryption-and-digital-signing-made-easy/">Kaspersky

		<p>Last Friday I announced the crowdfunding to a crowded audience at
		Berlin event
		"<a href="http://www.boell.de/en/whatever-happened-privacy">Whatever
		happened to privacy</a>", and Markus Beckedahl
		(<a href="https://netzpolitik.org/">Netzpolitik<a>)
		and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Appelbaum">Jacob
		Appelbaum</a> (Tor Project and Wikileaks) amplified the importance
		of supporting the project. Hugo Roy (FSFE) gave a talk on Wednesday
		about the campaign at the Paris
		'<a href="http://111213.net/">Hackadon</a>' - a new conference for
		Free Software giving, organised by three
		<a href="http://111213.net/#orga">crowdfunding
		organisations</a>. His slides are online in the
		GPG <a href="https://gitorious.org/gnupg/presentations">presentations
		repository</a>.</p>

		<p>Hopefully the crowdfunding page on Goteo (a Free Software
		Kickstarter) will be ready for launch next week. Email me if you can
		help with translating the press release - we're aiming for at least
		three languages. And don't forget you can still sign up for email
		updates (form below). Thanks for all your support so far!</p>

		<p>GnuPG can run almost anywhere</p>
		</div>

		<p>Email encryption is one of those pleasures that can't be enjoyed
		alone. Sending yourself messages secured with 4096-bit RSA is great
		for proof of concept, but meaningful communication requires two
		parties. GnuPG requires both those parties to have their own
		keys.</p>

		<p>Less than <abbr title="unscientific guess">1%</abbr> of all email
		traffic is PGP encrypted, meaning that those of us who do make our
		messages private routinely find ourselves in the frustrating
		predicament of having to share our thoughts insecurely, even though
		we know they're being intercepted, even though this is easily
		avoidable, and even though we've already taken steps to do so. All
		because our <strong>friends and colleagues</strong> don't know the
		benefits of GnuPG.</p>

		<p>Windows, Gnu/Linux, Mac, and Android all have point and click
		GnuPG interfaces - at this point, all bases except iPhone are more
		or less covered. That means the reason your contacts aren't OpenPGP
		ready is <strong>not technical</strong>. And because GnuPG is Free
		Software (and free of charge), it can't be about price.</p>

		<p>A recommendation from you is the most effective way you can
		increase the number of GnuPG users, and consequently increase the
		percentage of the messages you send that are meaningfully
		encrypted. That's why we're asking people in our community to think
		of pithy explanations of why GnuPG is important and how it enables
		them.</p>

		<p>We've already got quotes from some big names like Bruce Schneier,
		Jacob Appelbaum, and Richard Stallman. But the chances are
		that <strong>your name</strong> carries more weight among your
		peers. Please use it to share your appreciation for GnuPG!</p>

		<p>If you use social networks, you can
		use <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ilovegpg"
		target="blank">#iloveGPG</a> to connect your messages to other
		people's, and make is easier for us to find and repeat them.</p>

		<p>Look out for weekly quotes posted from the
		GnuPG <a target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/gnupg">Twitter</a>
		and <a target="blank"
		href="https://www.cryptospora.net/u/gnuprivacyguard">Diaspora</a>
		accounts if you need inspiration. Let's fill up
		the <a href="http://keys.gnupg.net/" target="blank">keyservers</a>
		with fresh keys from new users!</p>

		<h5>Posted 5th November 2013 by Sam Tuke</h5>

		<p>If you've noticed some changes around here, there's a good reason
		why. We have a plan for securing the long term stability of GnuPG
		development by giving more to our users, and asking more from them
		in return.</p>

		<p>You already know that GnuPG is important, and as months of fresh
		government spying revelations go by, it's becoming obvious that
		GnuPG is one of the very few tools that can still be trusted to keep
		our data safe from the overwhelming efforts of international law
		enforcement. But developing GnuPG takes work - regular monitoring
		for newfound threats and exploits, and new features to keep it sharp
		with the latest encryption algorithms. We also need to reach out to
		the millions of potential GnuPG users who are asking themselves how
		they can make their email secure. Public-private key cryptography
		hasn't yet gained mainstream acceptance, but it could if it were
		just a little more appealing and accessible.</p>

		<p>To maintain progress within the project we need to make it easier
		for GnuPG users to support the work that we do. Ours is an app that
		is often hidden from view, relied upon daily by hundreds of
		thousands of people, often in life-threatening circumstances, yet
		low profile and rarely supported by publicity or donations.</p>

		<p>To change that we're going to launch a <strong>new
		website</strong> with a fresh design, more friendly and accessible
		information, and new resources to grow and strengthen our user
		group. The new site will also allow the project to accept and manage
		new forms of financial support, including automatic subscriptions to
		sustain development long term.</p>

		<p>Designing, building and populating the new site will take a few
		months, and in order to cover the costs there will be
		a <strong>crowd-funding</strong> campaign with a modest target, in
		early December. We have some rewards up our sleeves for those who
		donate.</p>

		<p>When that time comes, <strong>we'll need your help</strong> -
		telling your contacts, forwarding the announcement to your
		communities, and contributing financially if you can.</p>

		<p>You can subscribe to updates about the campaign using this
		form. This is separate to other GnuPG mailing lists - update will be
		sent here, and only here.</p>

		<h5>Posted 30th October 2013 by Sam Tuke</h5>

		<p>Welcome to Gnu Privacy Guard's new blog! We're planning some
		major changes to gnupg.org and how the project communicates in
		general. I'm Sam, and I'll be writing updates here as our work
		progresses. In future this blog will be replaced with a more
		beautiful and featureful alternative, but bear with us as we get
		from here to there.</p>

		<p>For more timely updates you can follow our Twitter
		accounts: <a

		target="blank">@GnuPG</a>.
		That's right, we have two! But I'm going to combine them shortly so
		it's easier to keep track <strong>[UPDATE: accounts now merged!
		Stick with @GnuPG]</strong>.</p>
