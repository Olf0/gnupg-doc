   <p>Pending project on Goteo</p>
   </div>

   <p>The targets are set, the rewards are prepared, the press release
      has been edited and translated, and now we’re waiting for
      approval from the crowdfunding
      platform <a href="http://goteo.org/">Goteo</a>.</p>

   <p>Goteo is like indiegogo, but more forward thinking. It has a
      special focus on communal benefits and rewards - projects that
      benefit society as a whole, not just project donors (though they
      can get special rewards too).</p>


   <p>Every ’good’ produced by a campaign on Goteo, be it artwork,
      software, event, or manufactured product, has a license assigned
      to it, like GPL or Creative Commons, and as well as asking for
      money, projects ask for other forms of help called “non-economic
      needs”, like translations or product
      testing.  Goteo’s <a href="https://github.com/Goteo/Goteo">own
      source</a> code is Free Software too, meaning anyone can run
      their own Goteo crowdfunding server. That’s the feature that
      swung our decision to use it for GnuPG.</p>


	<p>Because the type of project on Goteo is quite specific
	however, the acceptance phase of launching crowdfunding is
	taking us longer than expected. Right now we’re working with
	Goteo’s small team to answer questions which aren’t on the
	webforms you fill out when you design your project with their
	system.</p>

	<p>I’m hoping to provide what’s necesasry and get acceptance
	quickly. As soon as we have it the crowdfunding will launch
	and <a href="http://gnupg.hosted.phplist.com/lists/?p=subscribe&id=1"
	>newsletter</a> subscribers
	and <a href="https://twitter.com/gnupg">Twitter</a> followers
	will be the first to know.</p>

  <h5>Posted 15 December 2013 by Werner Koch</h5>
  <p>
    [...]  To check how the forthcoming version 1.6.0 of Libgcrypt
    compares to the older 1.5 version of Libgcrypt, I did some benchmarks
    using a Thinkpad X220 which features an i5-2410M processor at 2.3GHz
    running a 64 bit Debian Wheezy.

  <p>Mid December, giving season, and nearly time for the GnuPG
  Crowdfunding to commence. We've been working hard on
  preparations. Drafts of the new mobile website design have been  published and met positive feedback, and a community-contibuted
  promo video was posted on YouTube. GnuPG coverage on Twitter
  continues to grow with many articles
  (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/nov/29/surveillance-online-campaigning-tips">The
  Guardian</a>, <a href="http://usblog.kaspersky.com/gpg-strong-encryption-and-digital-signing-made-easy/">Kaspersky
  Labs</a>, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/12/open-letter-urging-universities-encourage-conversation-about-online-privacy">The
  EFF</a>, <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/11/the-best-projects-and-gear-to-set-up-your-secret-lair/">Lifehacker</a>,
  ...) and 252 new followers in 6 weeks.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Last Friday I announced the crowdfunding to a crowded audience at
  Berlin event
  "<a href="http://www.boell.de/en/whatever-happened-privacy">Whatever
  happened to privacy</a>", and Markus Beckedahl
  (<a href="https://netzpolitik.org/">Netzpolitik<a>)
  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Appelbaum">Jacob
  Appelbaum</a> (Tor Project and Wikileaks) amplified the importance
  of supporting the project. Hugo Roy (FSFE) gave a talk on Wednesday
  about the campaign at the Paris
  '<a href="http://111213.net/">Hackadon</a>' - a new conference for
  Free Software giving, organised by three
   <a href="http://111213.net/#orga">crowdfunding
  organisations</a>. His slides are online in the
  GPG <a href="https://gitorious.org/gnupg/presentations">presentations
  repository</a>.</p>

  <p>Hopefully the crowdfunding page on Goteo (a Free Software
  Kickstarter) will be ready for launch next week. Email me if you can
  help with translating the press release - we're aiming for at least
  three languages. And don't forget you can still sign up for email
  updates (form below). Thanks for all your support so far!</p>

  <div class="captioned-img right">

    <p>GnuPG can run almost anywhere</p>
  </div>

  <p>Email encryption is one of those pleasures that can't be enjoyed
  alone. Sending yourself messages secured with 4096-bit RSA is great
  for proof of concept, but meaningful communication requires two
  parties. GnuPG requires both those parties to have their own
  keys.</p>

  <p>Less than <abbr title="unscientific guess">1%</abbr> of all email
  traffic is PGP encrypted, meaning that those of us who do make our
  messages private routinely find ourselves in the frustrating
  predicament of having to share our thoughts insecurely, even though
  we know they're being intercepted, even though this is easily
  avoidable, and even though we've already taken steps to do so. All
  because our <strong>friends and colleagues</strong> don't know the
  benefits of GnuPG.</p>

  <p>Windows, Gnu/Linux, Mac, and Android all have point and click
  GnuPG interfaces - at this point, all bases except iPhone are more
  or less covered. That means the reason your contacts aren't OpenPGP
  ready is <strong>not technical</strong>. And because GnuPG is Free
  Software (and free of charge), it can't be about price.</p>

  <p>A recommendation from you is the most effective way you can
  increase the number of GnuPG users, and consequently increase the
  percentage of the messages you send that are meaningfully
  encrypted. That's why we're asking people in our community to think
  of pithy explanations of why GnuPG is important and how it enables
  them.</p>

  <p>We've already got quotes from some big names like Bruce Schneier,
  Jacob Appelbaum, and Richard Stallman. But the chances are
  that <strong>your name</strong> carries more weight among your
  peers. Please use it to share your appreciation for GnuPG!</p>

  <p>If you use social networks, you can
  use <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ilovegpg"
  target="blank">#iloveGPG</a> to connect your messages to other
  people's, and make is easier for us to find and repeat them.</p>

  <p>Look out for weekly quotes posted from the
  GnuPG <a target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/gnupg">Twitter</a>
  and <a target="blank"
  href="https://www.cryptospora.net/u/gnuprivacyguard">Diaspora</a>
  accounts if you need inspiration. Let's fill up
  the <a href="http://keys.gnupg.net/" target="blank">keyservers</a>
  with fresh keys from new users!</p>

  <h5>Posted 5th November 2013 by Sam Tuke</h5>

  <p>If you've noticed some changes around here, there's a good reason
  why. We have a plan for securing the long term stability of GnuPG
  development by giving more to our users, and asking more from them
  in return.</p>

  <p>You already know that GnuPG is important, and as months of fresh
  government spying revelations go by, it's becoming obvious that
  GnuPG is one of the very few tools that can still be trusted to keep
  our data safe from the overwhelming efforts of international law
  enforcement. But developing GnuPG takes work - regular monitoring
  for newfound threats and exploits, and new features to keep it sharp
  with the latest encryption algorithms. We also need to reach out to
  the millions of potential GnuPG users who are asking themselves how
  they can make their email secure. Public-private key cryptography
  hasn't yet gained mainstream acceptance, but it could if it were
  just a little more appealing and accessible.</p>

  <p>To maintain progress within the project we need to make it easier
  for GnuPG users to support the work that we do. Ours is an app that
  is often hidden from view, relied upon daily by hundreds of
  thousands of people, often in life-threatening circumstances, yet
  low profile and rarely supported by publicity or donations.</p>

  <p>To change that we're going to launch a <strong>new
  website</strong> with a fresh design, more friendly and accessible
  information, and new resources to grow and strengthen our user
  group. The new site will also allow the project to accept and manage
  new forms of financial support, including automatic subscriptions to
  sustain development long term.</p>

  <p>Designing, building and populating the new site will take a few
  months, and in order to cover the costs there will be
  a <strong>crowd-funding</strong> campaign with a modest target, in
  early December. We have some rewards up our sleeves for those who
  donate.</p>

  <p>When that time comes, <strong>we'll need your help</strong> -
  telling your contacts, forwarding the announcement to your
  communities, and contributing financially if you can.</p>

  <p>You can subscribe to updates about the campaign using this
  form. This is separate to other GnuPG mailing lists - update will be
  sent here, and only here.</p>

  <h5>Posted 30th October 2013 by Sam Tuke</h5>

  <p>Welcome to Gnu Privacy Guard's new blog! We're planning some
  major changes to gnupg.org and how the project communicates in
  general. I'm Sam, and I'll be writing updates here as our work
  progresses. In future this blog will be replaced with a more
  beautiful and featureful alternative, but bear with us as we get
  from here to there.</p>

  <p>For more timely updates you can follow our Twitter
  accounts: <a
    href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=GnuPrivacyGuard"
    target="blank">@GnuPrivacyGuard</a>
  and <a
    href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=gnupg"
    target="blank">@GnuPG</a>.
  That's right, we have two! But I'm going to combine them shortly so
  it's easier to keep track <strong>[UPDATE: accounts now merged!
  Stick with @GnuPG]</strong>.</p>
