     ><h2>16 Years of protecting privacy</h2></a>
  <h5>Posted 20th December 2013 by Sam Tuke</h5>

<p>
Today marks 16 years since the first release of GNU Privacy Guard
(GnuPG). In that time the project has grown from being a hacker’s
hobby into one of the world’s most critical anti-surveillance
tools. Today GnuPG stands at the front line of the battle between
invasive surveillance and civil liberties.
</p>

<p>
“Time has proven <a href="http://fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/4freedoms.en.html">Free Software</a> to be the most trustworthy defender
against companies and governments seeking to undermine citizen
privacy” said Werner Koch, GnuPG Founder and Lead Developer. “Although
funding our work has not always been easy, the need for universally
accessible privacy tools has never been more apparent”.
</p>

<p>
Some of the world’s top security specialists are now counted among
GnuPG users, including Bruce Schneier, Jacob Appelbaum, and Phil
Zimmerman, inventor of PGP. This summer the world learned of the
extent of Government spying thanks to whistleblowers and journalists
communicating using GnuPG encrypted emails. Market leading servers
from Red Hat and Debian have built their reputation for security on
the foundation of GnuPG-verified software.
</p>

<p>
“The success of GnuPG’s first crowdfunding campaign, which received
90% of it’s target in 24 hours, shows a fresh willingness among users
to support GnuPG in it’s 16th year, and points to new opportunities
for the project in future” said Sam Tuke, GnuPG Campaign Manager.
“The release of GnuPG 2.1 and the launch of a newly designed website
later this year will bring GnuPG and its clients for Windows, Mac,
Gnu/Linux, and Android to new audiences”.
</p>

<p>
Over the years GnuPG has kept up to date with new algorithms, such as
Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and reactive to new threats, such as key
extraction via acoustic monitoring, which was announced two days ago
by researchers as GnuPG updates were released, in coordination with
developers. Members remain confident of the future of GnuPG and look
forward to facing the privacy threats of tomorrow with community
support.

     ><h2>Press release: GnuPG encryption project launches crowdfunding
  campaign</h2></a>
  <h5>Posted 19th December 2013 by Sam Tuke</h5>


  <p>Today GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) has launched its first
   <a href="http://goteo.org/project/gnupg-new-website-and-infrastructure"
      >crowdfunding campaign</a> with the aim of building a new
      website and long term infrastructure. The 24.000 EUR target will
      fund:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Fresh web interfaces for gnupg.org including mobile</li>
  <li>Completion and release of GnuPG 2.1</li>
  <li>Anonymous Tor network access to the website</li>
  <li>A new user friendly download page suitable for all devices</li>
  <li>A new server for web services</li>
  <li>New pages convening external guides, videos, and handbooks</li>
  <li>Facilities for processing recurring donations for long
      term project support</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Project founder and Lead Developer Werner Koch said “GnuPG has
  seen a huge upsurge in popularity following recent state
  spying revelations. After 16 years of continuous development,
  we are now asking for community support to capitalise on
  consumer demand for privacy, and make GnuPG easy to access for
  mainstream audiences”.</p>

  <p>GnuPG is one of the few tools remaining above suspicion in the
  wake of leaked NSA documents. Edward Snowden and his contacts
  including Bruce Schneier switched to GnuPG when they began handling
  the secret
  documents <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-how-to-remain-secure-surveillance">earlier
  this year</a>. The Wall Street Journal, The Committee to Protect
  Journalists,
  and <a href="http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/hacks_hackers_security_for_jou.php">ProPublica</a>
  have all embraced GnuPG for protection of staff and sources. Phil
  Zimmermann, original inventor of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), has also
  moved to GnuPG in wake of the news.</p>

  <p>“GnuPG is a key part of modern privacy infrastructure” said
  Sam Tuke, Campaign Manager, GnuPG. “Millions of users rely on
  GnuPG to work securely on servers, laptops and smartphones,
  but 2013 donations totaling 3.000 EUR to date have not even
  covered fixed costs. Supporting new algorithms like elliptical
  curve and fixing newfound exploits fast takes a lot of work
  which is done voluntarily. Now is the time for people to
  contribute to making GnuPG slick and more sustainable in
  future”.</p>

  <p>Jacob Appelbaum, Tor Project developer, added “GnuPG is
  important - it allows us the assurances we need to do our
  work. Community funding is a critical part of a confident
  outlook for GnuPG in future.”</p>

        title="Project status on Goteo" />
   <p>Pending project on Goteo</p>
   </div>

   <p>The targets are set, the rewards are prepared, the press release
      has been edited and translated, and now we’re waiting for
      approval from the crowdfunding
      platform <a href="http://goteo.org/">Goteo</a>.</p>

   <p>Goteo is like indiegogo, but more forward thinking. It has a
      special focus on communal benefits and rewards - projects that
      benefit society as a whole, not just project donors (though they
      can get special rewards too).</p>


   <p>Every ’good’ produced by a campaign on Goteo, be it artwork,
      software, event, or manufactured product, has a license assigned
      to it, like GPL or Creative Commons, and as well as asking for
      money, projects ask for other forms of help called “non-economic
      needs”, like translations or product
      testing.  Goteo’s <a href="https://github.com/Goteo/Goteo">own
      source</a> code is Free Software too, meaning anyone can run
      their own Goteo crowdfunding server. That’s the feature that
      swung our decision to use it for GnuPG.</p>


	<p>Because the type of project on Goteo is quite specific
	however, the acceptance phase of launching crowdfunding is
	taking us longer than expected. Right now we’re working with
	Goteo’s small team to answer questions which aren’t on the
	webforms you fill out when you design your project with their
	system.</p>

	<p>I’m hoping to provide what’s necesasry and get acceptance
	quickly. As soon as we have it the crowdfunding will launch
	and <a href="http://gnupg.hosted.phplist.com/lists/?p=subscribe&id=1"
	>newsletter</a> subscribers
	and <a href="https://twitter.com/gnupg">Twitter</a> followers
	will be the first to know.</p>

    [...]  To check how the forthcoming version 1.6.0 of Libgcrypt
    compares to the older 1.5 version of Libgcrypt, I did some benchmarks
    using a Thinkpad X220 which features an i5-2410M processor at 2.3GHz

  <p>Mid December, giving season, and nearly time for the GnuPG
  Crowdfunding to commence. We've been working hard on
  preparations. Drafts of the new mobile website design have been  published and met positive feedback, and a community-contibuted
  promo video was posted on YouTube. GnuPG coverage on Twitter
  continues to grow with many articles
  (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/nov/29/surveillance-online-campaigning-tips">The

  <p>Last Friday I announced the crowdfunding to a crowded audience at
  Berlin event
  "<a href="http://www.boell.de/en/whatever-happened-privacy">Whatever
  happened to privacy</a>", and Markus Beckedahl
  (<a href="https://netzpolitik.org/">Netzpolitik<a>)
  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Appelbaum">Jacob
  Appelbaum</a> (Tor Project and Wikileaks) amplified the importance
  of supporting the project. Hugo Roy (FSFE) gave a talk on Wednesday
  about the campaign at the Paris
  '<a href="http://111213.net/">Hackadon</a>' - a new conference for
  Free Software giving, organised by three
   <a href="http://111213.net/#orga">crowdfunding
  organisations</a>. His slides are online in the
  GPG <a href="https://gitorious.org/gnupg/presentations">presentations
  repository</a>.</p>

  <p>Hopefully the crowdfunding page on Goteo (a Free Software
  Kickstarter) will be ready for launch next week. Email me if you can
  help with translating the press release - we're aiming for at least
  three languages. And don't forget you can still sign up for email
  updates (form below). Thanks for all your support so far!</p>

    <p>GnuPG can run almost anywhere</p>
  </div>

  <p>Email encryption is one of those pleasures that can't be enjoyed
  alone. Sending yourself messages secured with 4096-bit RSA is great
  for proof of concept, but meaningful communication requires two
  parties. GnuPG requires both those parties to have their own
  keys.</p>

  <p>Less than <abbr title="unscientific guess">1%</abbr> of all email
  traffic is PGP encrypted, meaning that those of us who do make our
  messages private routinely find ourselves in the frustrating
  predicament of having to share our thoughts insecurely, even though
  we know they're being intercepted, even though this is easily
  avoidable, and even though we've already taken steps to do so. All
  because our <strong>friends and colleagues</strong> don't know the
  benefits of GnuPG.</p>

  <p>Windows, Gnu/Linux, Mac, and Android all have point and click
  GnuPG interfaces - at this point, all bases except iPhone are more
  or less covered. That means the reason your contacts aren't OpenPGP
  ready is <strong>not technical</strong>. And because GnuPG is Free
  Software (and free of charge), it can't be about price.</p>

  <p>A recommendation from you is the most effective way you can
  increase the number of GnuPG users, and consequently increase the
  percentage of the messages you send that are meaningfully
  encrypted. That's why we're asking people in our community to think
  of pithy explanations of why GnuPG is important and how it enables
  them.</p>

  <p>We've already got quotes from some big names like Bruce Schneier,
  Jacob Appelbaum, and Richard Stallman. But the chances are
  that <strong>your name</strong> carries more weight among your
  peers. Please use it to share your appreciation for GnuPG!</p>

  <p>If you use social networks, you can
  use <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ilovegpg"
  target="blank">#iloveGPG</a> to connect your messages to other
  people's, and make is easier for us to find and repeat them.</p>

  <p>Look out for weekly quotes posted from the
  GnuPG <a target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/gnupg">Twitter</a>
  and <a target="blank"
  href="https://www.cryptospora.net/u/gnuprivacyguard">Diaspora</a>

  <h5>Posted 5th November 2013 by Sam Tuke</h5>

  <p>If you've noticed some changes around here, there's a good reason
  why. We have a plan for securing the long term stability of GnuPG
  development by giving more to our users, and asking more from them
  in return.</p>

  <p>You already know that GnuPG is important, and as months of fresh
  government spying revelations go by, it's becoming obvious that
  GnuPG is one of the very few tools that can still be trusted to keep
  our data safe from the overwhelming efforts of international law
  enforcement. But developing GnuPG takes work - regular monitoring
  for newfound threats and exploits, and new features to keep it sharp
  with the latest encryption algorithms. We also need to reach out to
  the millions of potential GnuPG users who are asking themselves how
  they can make their email secure. Public-private key cryptography
  hasn't yet gained mainstream acceptance, but it could if it were
  just a little more appealing and accessible.</p>

  <p>To maintain progress within the project we need to make it easier
  for GnuPG users to support the work that we do. Ours is an app that
  is often hidden from view, relied upon daily by hundreds of
  thousands of people, often in life-threatening circumstances, yet
  low profile and rarely supported by publicity or donations.</p>

  <p>To change that we're going to launch a <strong>new
  website</strong> with a fresh design, more friendly and accessible
  information, and new resources to grow and strengthen our user
  group. The new site will also allow the project to accept and manage
  new forms of financial support, including automatic subscriptions to
  sustain development long term.</p>

  <p>Designing, building and populating the new site will take a few
  months, and in order to cover the costs there will be
  a <strong>crowd-funding</strong> campaign with a modest target, in
  early December. We have some rewards up our sleeves for those who
  donate.</p>

  <p>When that time comes, <strong>we'll need your help</strong> -
  telling your contacts, forwarding the announcement to your
  communities, and contributing financially if you can.</p>

  <p>You can subscribe to updates about the campaign using this
  form. This is separate to other GnuPG mailing lists - update will be
  sent here, and only here.</p>
