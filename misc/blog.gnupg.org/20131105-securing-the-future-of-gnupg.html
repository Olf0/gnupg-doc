											>Securing the future of GPG</h1>
											<h5>Posted 5th November 2013 by Sam Tuke</h5>

											<p>If you've noticed some changes around here, there's a good reason
											why. We have a plan for securing the long term stability of GnuPG
											development by giving more to our users, and asking more from them
											in return.</p>

											<p>You already know that GnuPG is important, and as months of fresh
											government spying revelations go by, it's becoming obvious that
											GnuPG is one of the very few tools that can still be trusted to keep
											our data safe from the overwhelming efforts of international law
											enforcement. But developing GnuPG takes work - regular monitoring
											for newfound threats and exploits, and new features to keep it sharp
											with the latest encryption algorithms. We also need to reach out to
											the millions of potential GnuPG users who are asking themselves how
											they can make their email secure. Public-private key cryptography
											hasn't yet gained mainstream acceptance, but it could if it were
											just a little more appealing and accessible.</p>

											<p>To maintain progress within the project we need to make it easier
											for GnuPG users to support the work that we do. Ours is an app that
											is often hidden from view, relied upon daily by hundreds of
											thousands of people, often in life-threatening circumstances, yet
											low profile and rarely supported by publicity or donations.</p>

											<p>To change that we're going to launch a <strong>new
											website</strong> with a fresh design, more friendly and accessible
											information, and new resources to grow and strengthen our user
											group. The new site will also allow the project to accept and manage
											new forms of financial support, including automatic subscriptions to
											sustain development long term.</p>

											<p>Designing, building and populating the new site will take a few
											months, and in order to cover the costs there will be
											a <strong>crowd-funding</strong> campaign with a modest target, in
											early December. We have some rewards up our sleeves for those who
											donate.</p>

											<p>When that time comes, <strong>we'll need your help</strong> -
											telling your contacts, forwarding the announcement to your
											communities, and contributing financially if you can.</p>

											<p>You can subscribe to updates about the campaign using this
											form. This is separate to other GnuPG mailing lists - update will be
											sent here, and only here.</p>
