Email encryption is one of those pleasures that can't be enjoyed alone.
Sending yourself messages secured with 4096-bit RSA is great for proof
of concept, but meaningful communication requires two parties. GnuPG
requires both those parties to have their own keys.

Less than 1% of all email traffic is PGP encrypted, meaning that those
of us who do make our messages private routinely find ourselves in the
frustrating predicament of having to share our thoughts insecurely, even
though we know they're being intercepted, even though this is easily
avoidable, and even though we've already taken steps to do so. All
because our *friends and colleagues* don't know the benefits of GnuPG.

Windows, Gnu/Linux, Mac, and Android all have point and click GnuPG
interfaces - at this point, all bases except iPhone are more or less
covered. That means the reason your contacts aren't OpenPGP ready is
*not technical*. And because GnuPG is Free Software (and free of
charge), it can't be about price.

A recommendation from you is the most effective way you can increase the
number of GnuPG users, and consequently increase the percentage of the
messages you send that are meaningfully encrypted. That's why we're
asking people in our community to think of pithy explanations of why
GnuPG is important and how it enables them.

We've already got quotes from some big names like Bruce Schneier, Jacob
Appelbaum, and Richard Stallman. But the chances are that *your name*
carries more weight among your peers. Please use it to share your
appreciation for GnuPG!

If you use social networks, you can use [[https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ilovegpg][#iloveGPG]] to connect your
messages to other people's, and make is easier for us to find and
repeat them.

Look out for weekly quotes posted from the GnuPG [[https://twitter.com/gnupg][Twitter]] and [[https://www.cryptospora.net/u/gnuprivacyguard][Diaspora]]
accounts if you need inspiration. Let's fill up the [[http://keys.gnupg.net/][keyservers]] with
fresh keys from new users!
