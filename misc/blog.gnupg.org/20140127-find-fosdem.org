On Friday Werner and Sam are heading to [[https://fosdem.org/2014/][FOSDEM]], the largest Free
Software conference in Europe, along with many GnuPG hackers, users,
and supporters. [[http://gnupg.totemapp.com/company][Get in touch]] if you'd like to talk about the existing
or future campaigns while we're there.

There won't be a GnuPG booth this year but, we shall be busy with
meetings and mingling. Notes and contacts for us can be left at the
[[https://fosdem.org/2014/stands/][FSFE booth]].

And don't forget that you're invited to the continent's biggest
keysigning party, organised by FOSDEM volunteers. Today is the last
opportunity to [[https://fosdem.org/2014/keysigning/][submit your key]], which is necessary for
participation. Get to it!.

Bring your ideas. See you there.
