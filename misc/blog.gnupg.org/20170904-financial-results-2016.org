** Financial Results for 2016

Having prepared the annual accounts for g10^code GmbH, the legal
entity employing some of the GnuPG hackers, I can now share a
financial report.  Please read on if you are interested in how we
earned and spent the money from donations and paid projects.

*** Balance Sheet as of 2016-12-31

    Let us start by looking at the balance sheet, which describes
    our financial status.  The following table shows the actual
    [[file:data/g10code-bilanz-2016-pub.pdf][balance sheet]] with a few accounts pooled up.  Note that for
    display purposes all values have been rounded to a full Euro, and
    thus there are minor mismatches in the Sums row.

    The /Bank balance KSD/ is the money that we had at the end of the year
    in our accounts at the local savings bank.  The /PayPal/ row gives
    the amount of money in the PayPal account and as several prepaid
    accounts.

    From the /Common capital stock/ of 25000 Euro 50% are held by
    Walter Koch and 50% by Werner Koch, the owners of g10^code.  The
    /Net profit/ gained in 2015 is added to /Profit carried forward/.

    The /Accounts payable other/ is my profit sharing bonus of 24739
    and VAT payable for the last quarter.  The /GnuPG development
    fund/ is the rest of a campaign which collected prize money for
    the GnuPG logo.

    The major /Revenues/ items are grants from the Linux Foundation
    (54,219 €), Facebook (44,715 €), Stripe (47,824 €), and from these
    paid projects: Gpg4VS-NfD (79,800 €), Gpg4All (48,000 €), and
    EasyGPG (65,000 €).

    The /Rents/ are for the room used as an office in my house.
    /Other expenses/ sums up money spent for magazines, power, office
    supplies, advertising, conference fees, legal costs, etc.
    Donations have been given to [[https://netzpolitik.org][Netzpolitik.org]], [[http://www.freundeskreis-fluechtlinge-erkrath.de/][Freundeskreis für
    Flüchtlinge in Erkrath]], [[https://wikimedia.de][Wikimedia]], and the [[https://freie-software.de][Freie Software Freunde]].

    As with almost all software development companies, the majority of
    expenses are staff costs.  Not counting taxes, which depend on the
    the annual profit, we had total costs of 225,000 € with 207,000 €
    spent on /Salaries/, /Social insurance/, and /Contractors/.  My
    share of this were 47,400 € regular salary (of which I need to pay
    social insurances fully myself) plus a profit sharing bonus of
    24700 €.  We made quite some profit last years due to the good
    revenue situation and because one of our employees substantially
    reduced his working hours to finish his PhD.
