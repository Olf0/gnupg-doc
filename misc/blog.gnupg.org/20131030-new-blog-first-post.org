** New blog, first post

Welcome to Gnu Privacy Guard's new blog! We're planning some major
changes to gnupg.org and how the project communicates in general. I'm
Sam, and I'll be writing updates here as our work progresses. In
future this blog will be replaced with a more beautiful and featureful
alternative, but bear with us as we get from here to there.

For more timely updates you can follow our Twitter accounts:
[[https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=GnuPrivacyGuard][@GnuPrivacyGuard]] and [[https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=gnupg][@GnuPG]].  That's right, we have two! But I'm going
to combine them shortly so it's easier to keep track *[UPDATE:
accounts now merged! Stick with @GnuPG]*.

For more information, see our [[http://gnupg.totemapp.com/company][press contact page]] hosted on
Totem. That's all for now.
