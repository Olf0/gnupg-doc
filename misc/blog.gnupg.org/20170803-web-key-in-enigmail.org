** Using the Web Key Service with Enigmail

Obtaining the public key of someone has always being a major pain point of
using GnuPG. OpenPGP doesn't "outsource" trust management by using a PKI.
Instead, it allows each user to decide whom to trust. This has the downside
that we need to evaluate whether we can trust a new public key for each
new communication partner. Until recently, there wasn't an automatic way to
securely get the public key of someone you never communicated with.

The [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service-04][Web Key Service]] and the ~--auto-key-retrieve~ &
~--auto-key-locate~ enhancements available in GnuPG 2.1.16 and beyond.

*** Web Key Service

The Web Key Service is a protocol to publish public OpenPGP keys via
email and retrieve others' public keys using HTTPS. The advantage over
HKPS is that every email provider maintains its own key
server (called Web Key Directory, WKD) that is authoritative for all
its users. This means that:

1. There exists only one key server for a given email address. No need to ask
   multiple servers as with HKPS.

2. When publishing a public key using mail, WKD makes sure the sender is in
   possession of the secret key.

3. Email providers can (and should) make sure that only the owner of the
   email account is able to publish a public key for it.

Point three helps us with trust management. In case we trust the email
provider of our communication partner, we can trust the key retrieved by WKD
more than one from an HKPS based key server.

*** Publish your public key to a Web Key Directory

In order to use WKS you need a provider who supports it [fn:1]. After you
configured the email account in Thunderbird you need to enable OpenPGP for
it and generate a key pair.

Then, open the key management window and find your public key. Right clicking
it opens the context menu. There, select the option to upload the public key
to your provider's WKD.

After submission, the WKD will send an email to you asking to confirm the
publication request. The subject line and body copy can be defined by the WKD
but Enigmail will display a yellow bar above the message announcing it is a
confirmation request. Clicking the button on the right will send the
confirmation email to WKD.

After the email has been sent, your public key will be accessible to
everybody.

*** Receive others public key from a Web Key Directory

Recent version of Enigmail receive missing public keys automatically form
multiple sources, including WKD. Everybody who wants to send you an encrypted
email will be able to do so without finding your public key manually first.

This is a bit anticlimactic, but you can use the ~--auto-key-locate~
option to retrieve your own public key from the WKD to see if it worked.

~HOME=`mktemp -d` gpg2 --auto-key-locate wkd -e -r <your email address>~

If GnuPG is able to retrieve the public key you will see a line that looks
like that:

~gpg: automatically retrieved '<your email address>' via WKD~

  Fixed URL auf the Web Key Service draft and updated to the current
  -04 version.

[fn:1] As the time of writing only [[https://posteo.de/en][Posteo]] supports
       WKS.
