After 50 days of crowdfunding, the [[http://goteo.org/project/gnupg-new-website-and-infrastructure][GnuPG campaign]] for new website and
infrastructure will close tomorrow. That means rewards for backers can
now be ordered and preparations for dispatch can begin. Here are the
results so far:

-  36.741 EUR raised out of 24.000 target
-  1.081 people donated in support
-  350 EUR Largest single donation
-  33 EUR average donation
-  365 Stickers claimed
-  300 T-shirts claimed
-  191 GnuPG email addresses claimed
-  793 Additional Twitter followers (from 60)

Goteo, the Free Software platform hosting the campaign, usually required
two 40 day rounds of funding, but in our case we're ending early, after
just 50 days. This will enable us to deliver the new site and GnuPG 2.1
faster, and is possible thanks to reaching our goal so quickly (in just
26 hours).

We're currently preparing a system for collecting donor preferences for
their rewards (sizes, addresses, etc.), so expect to be contacted in the
next week or two if that includes you.

Thanks again to all our backers for the overwhelming support that GnuPG
has received!
