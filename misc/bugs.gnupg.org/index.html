<h1><a name="intro">Bug tracker for GnuPG and related projects</a></h1>

<p>


<ul>
 <li>Goto to the list of <a
href="https://bugs.gnupg.org/gnupg/issue?%40sort=id&%40sortdir=on&%40group=category&%40columns=id%2Cactivity%2Ctitle%2Ccreator%2Cassignedto%2Cstatus&%40filter=status&status=-1%2C1%2C2%2C3%2C4%2C5%2C6%2C7&%40pagesize=50&%40startwith=0"
>GnuPG related bugs</a>.
</ul>


<h2>Becoming a registered user</h2>
<p>
To enter a bug into our bug tracker you need to be a registered user.
A registered user will be assigned a <em>provisional user role</em>
which allows to enter new bugs and to edit these bugs.  The <em>user
role</em> will be granted by an administrator on demand.  Just add
remark to your bug report that you wish to work more with the bug
tracker.  We have these strict rules to avoid spam and keep trolls
away from the tracker.
<p>
Note that some actions (e.g. closing a bug) are even restricted from
regular users.  A developer account is required for these actions.
The rationale is that only a developer will be able to fix things and
thus decides whether a bug is to be closed.  A bug may be re-opened at
any time.


<h2>How to add a new bug</h2>
<p>
Please note that this bug tracker is a public resource and everything
you enter there will be available for the whole networked world.  It
is similar to a public mailing list and there is no easy way to
retract any information.
<p>
You should follow these steps to enter a new bug (issue):
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Review the documentation and the mailing list archives to see
     whether your problem has already been addressed.  Often bugs are
     mere configuration problems.
     <p>
 <li>Check that the bug has not yet been entered and that there is no
     similar bug in the tracker.  Use the search option for this.  It
     is best to also look through the already closed
     (<em>resolved</em>) issue.
     <p>

 <li>If you consider the bug a severe security problem and you do not
     want to publish it, please write to security at gnupg.org to ask
     for advice and our encryption keys.  See also the AUTHORS file in
     each package.
     <p>

 <li>Select the <em>Create New</em> menu entry.  An empty page will be
     presented.
     <p>

 <li>Come up with a meaningful short description of the bug and enter
     this into the <em>title</em> field.
     <p>

 <li>Assign a priority for the bug. These priorities are
     defined:
     <p>
     <dl>
       <dt>bug<dd>Use this for a regular bug.
       <dt>urgent<dd>Use this if you believe that the problem should
       be fixed soon.
       <dt>critical<dd>Use this if your problem is really severe and inhibits
       you from working with the software.  Do not use it if you can
       find a workaround for the problem.
       <dt>minor-bug<dd>Use this for a minor bug
       <dt>feature<dd>Use this for a technical feature requests.
       <dt>wish<dd>Use this for everything else, for example to
       request better documentation or a new FAQ entry.
     </dl>
     <p>

 <li>See whether you can assign category to the bug. There is a drop
     down list with all available categories.  A category is in
     general the name of the application with the bug, but might also
     be a library.  If you can't figure out the category, keep it at
     <em>- no selection -</em>.  The <em>dirmngr</em> category is only
     used for the old standalone package; since GnuPG 2.1 dirmngr
     is part of GnuPG proper; thus use <em>gnupg</em> as category and
     add <em>dirmngr</em> to the topic field.
     <p>

 <li>Now for the most important field: The description of the problem.
     You enter this information into the <em>Change Note</em> field.
     Please take care to use hard line breaks and format the report
     as you would do by mail.  No HTML please.
     <p>
     Make sure that you describe the bug as good as possible and try
     to come up with a minimal recipe on how to replicate the bug. We
     need to know <strong>the version of the software</strong> and if
     you are using a non-released version the GIT commit id.  The type
     and version of your operating system is usually important, so
     please tell us.  In particular tell us if you are problem occurs
     on a non Unix system, i.e. MS Windows.
     <p>

 <li>If you need to enter more information, you may upload any kind of
     file.  However, please do this only if you are sure that these
     information are important and that they do not contain
     confidential data.  This file will be public and it won't be
     possible to retract it anymore.  Avoid screen shots unless you
     are asked for them.
     <p>
     The problem with screen shots or, worse, screen casts is that we
     would need to transcript them to text for evaluating the problem.
     That takes away time we better spend solving the problem; it
     is easy to help us by providing a transcription
     <p>

 <li>If you are sure that your bug is MS Windows specific, please
     enter the string "w32" into the <em>Topics</em> field.  You do
     not need to do it if you select a Windows specific category (like
     "gpgol").
     <p>

 <li>If you want to refer to an external bug description (for example
     a similar entry in Debian's bug tracker), enter the URL into the
     <em>ExtLink</em> field.
     <p>

 <li>If everything is as you want it, select the <em>Submit New
     Entry</em> button.  This entry as well as all future changes will
     also be mailed to you.
     <p>
