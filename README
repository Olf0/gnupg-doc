README for the gnupg-doc repository                         -*- org -*-

This is a separated branch for the gnupg.org website.

The old website was tracked in a CVS repository but we want to start
the new website form scratch using only the texts from the generated
HTML files.

** Directory structure

   - web/      :: Source files for the web.  This also include images
                  etc.
   - web/share :: Logos, CSS, macros and elisp for building.
   - misc      :: Otehr websites etc.
   - build-aux :: Build helper rscripts
   - tools/    :: Tools used to build the web site.
   - stage/    :: staging directory for the site.

** Aliases

www.gnupg.org uses Boa to serve the pages, here are the aliases we
use:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# The manuals are maintained outside of the web pages;
# thus we use an alias to copy them in.
Alias /documentation/manuals /var/www/shared/manuals
Alias /gph /var/www/shared/gph

# The FAQ is located in the manuals directory but linked to the faq directory
Alias /faq/GnuPG-FAQ.html  /var/www/shared/manuals/GnuPG-FAQ.html


# Redirect a couple of well-known URLs
Redirect /gpa.html      http://www.gnupg.org/related_software/gpa/
Redirect /gpgme.html    http://www.gnupg.org/related_software/gpgme/
Redirect /docs.html     http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/
Redirect /download.html http://www.gnupg.org/download/
Redirect /faq.html      http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/faqs.html

# We use redirect to make language switching work.
Redirect /why-not-idea.html  http://www.gnupg.org/faq/why-not-idea.html

Redirect /howtos/ch/  http://www.gnupg.org/howtos/zh/
#+END_EXAMPLE

The howtos are symlinked into the www.gnupg.org tree.


** Symlinks

For compatibility with the old webseite it is best to run this script
in the htdocs directory:

for d in $(find . -type d); \\
   do (cd $d && for f in $(ls *.html | grep -v '*.??.html'); \\
       do ln -s $f ${f%.html}.en.html; ln -s $f ${f%.html}.de.html ; \\
   done ); done
