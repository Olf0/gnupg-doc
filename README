README for the website branch.                           -*- org -*-

This is a separated branch for the gnupg.org website.

The old website was tracked in a CVS repository but we want to start
the new website form scratch using only the texts from the generated
HTML files.

** Directory structure

   - web/ :: Source files for the web.  This also include imagages
             etc.
   - web/share :: Logos, CSS, macros and elisp for building.
   - tools/ :: Tools used to build the web site.
   - stage/ :: staging directory for the site.

** Aliases

www.gnupg.org uses boa to serve the pages, here are the aliases we
use:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# The manuals are maintained outside of the web pages;
# thus we use an alias to copy them in.
Alias /documentation/manuals /var/www/shared/manuals
Alias /gph /var/www/shared/gph

# The FAQ is located in the manuals directory but linked to the faq directory
Alias /faq/GnuPG-FAQ.html  /var/www/shared/manuals/GnuPG-FAQ.html
